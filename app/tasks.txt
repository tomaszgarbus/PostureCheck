Need:
- Grid chart for all time
- Implement line chart for first > 0 entries (show times then)
- Send first notifications already on the first day
- Send first notification immediately after onboarding
- Test the app on emulated wearos
- Add in settings a button to allow notifications (go to settings to enable them)
- Implement or delete the "temporarily disable notifications" button
- Add "schedule notification 10s from now" option in Admin settings
- Import/export progress file
- Fallback to shorter period plot if it doesn't lose data, for example instead of all time show month if we only have data from one month.
- On line chart show nicer labels

Want:
