Need:
- Fix: Send first notification immediately after onboarding
- Test scheduling notifications on 1st day
- Test the app on emulated wearos
- Fallback to shorter period plot if it doesn't lose data, for example instead of all time show
  month if we only have data from one month.
- Scroll grid chart for all time to the right by default
- Give better name o notification channel
- Start from the settings screen after first onboarding
- Send the user to grant alarm permissions

Want:
- Show notification when new stats are available
- Implement line chart for first > 0 entries (show times then)
- Import/export progress file
- Add in settings a button to allow notifications (go to settings to enable them)
- Implement the "temporarily disable notifications" button
