- Grid chart for all time
- Implement line chart for first > 0 entries (show times then)
- Send first notifications already on the first day
- Send first notification immediately after onboarding
- Test the app on emulated wearos
- Show notification when new stats are available
- Add in settings a button to allow notifications (go to settings to enable them)
- Implement or delete the "temporarily disable notifications" button
- Yes, we will have banner with text about it, but up to 7 days we can show line chart to present current progress. Is it possible to do so? Without switcher to grid chart, without dropdown with time periods.
- Add "schedule notification 10s from now" option in Admin settings
- Import/export progress file
- Fix grid chart for missing data
