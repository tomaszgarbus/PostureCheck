Need:
- Send first notifications already on the first day
- Send first notification immediately after onboarding
- Test the app on emulated wearos
- Implement or delete the "temporarily disable notifications" button
- Fallback to shorter period plot if it doesn't lose data, for example instead of all time show month if we only have data from one month.
- Scroll grid chart for all time to the right by default
- Give better name o notification channel

Want:
- Show notification when new stats are available
- Implement line chart for first > 0 entries (show times then)
- Import/export progress file
- Add in settings a button to allow notifications (go to settings to enable them)
